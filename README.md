This repository is intended for the MIT Admissions Maker portfolio.
Includes versions #1-13 of the code I developed for my thrust vector control model rocket, which is included in the maker portfolio.
All versions developed in and intented for use in the Arduino IDE, and were run on a Arduino Nano BLE Sense rev2. Full wiring schematics will be included in the maker portfolio.
This repository was made by James Leising.
